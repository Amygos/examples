# Cert Manager with Typed API

This example shows how to generate a strongly-typed SDK for the [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)
Kubernetes add-on. `cert-manager` uses several CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) to define new API
types in Kubernetes. These CRDs are complex, but the auto-generated SDKs make it much easier to
work with.

## Prerequisites

TODO: do we need this? maybe just generate the SDK and show usage
